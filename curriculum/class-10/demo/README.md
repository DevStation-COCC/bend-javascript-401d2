# Demos: Block 2 - DS&A, Designs, Comp Sci, Recap 

### Stacks and Queues  [`demo/bitmap-demo.js`]

[Common Curriculum Stacks & Queues Demo](https://github.com/codefellows/common_curriculum/tree/master/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/demos/javascript)

Don't go much deeper than the core implementation of the stacks and queues

* Create the core properties and scaffold out the required methods.
* Implement `peek()`, pseudocode the others

### Menus (SASS)

* Talk through the options for creating menus and other ways to manipulate lists.
* This demo shows one way of doing horizontal drop lists
* It also demonstates the checkbox trick for hamburgers
* It has been helpful in the past to talk about, with drawings, how these can work and then pair program part of the implementation with either a TA or a student, getting input from the class

Generally speaking, the SASS demos are great when interactively, as most students have a decent understanding of CSS and are much more willing to contribute ideas.
